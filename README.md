# Djember
Sample application that integrates EmberJS with Django and DRF

#Some details to consider:
When cloning this repo please be sure to create a mysql instace named inventory for the inventory app the project comprehends. You'll need to config the db.cnf file according to your mysql configuration (username, password and port), so you can stablish the connection between the app and the inventory DB.

Also, be sure to run pip install django-rest-framework in order to download DRF to your system.
